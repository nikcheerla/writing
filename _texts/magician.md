<h1 class="page-title">The Magician</h1>

I slick my hair back for the camera. A jack of diamonds grins obscenely into the palm of my hand. Paul fiddles with the reflectors one last time … and it’s showtime. 

Up and to the left, down and around, curving my fingers at *exactly* the right angle so that gravity works for me. My right hand falls in perfect sync with the playing card, shielding its descent from prying eyes. 

Normally, I could pull off a double vanish in my sleep, but this particular trick is far harder on video. When I’m working a person, I can track their eyes and hide my hands between the gaps in their attention, like a climber hoisting themselves up via crevices in stone. But the camera’s gaze is fixed and starkly geometric, a slippery-smooth wall in which I can find no purchase. I screw up around the third exchange; my left hand misses the handoff by an amateurishly large margin, grasping at nothing but thin air. 

A strange feeling suffuses my body instead of the expected embarrassment. It’s like I’m standing at the edge of a cliff. No, it’s more like an old Wile. E. Coyote cartoon. Like some unaccountable inner voice is screaming at me, “You’re hanging suspended in midair, 50 goddamn feet from the ground please, for the love of God, don’t look down. *Don’t. Look. Down.*”

Click. Click. Click. Paul is beaming, reaching over the tripod at me with an offered high-five. 

“I blew it, man,” I say, “so why the fuck are you smiling?” 

“You *blew* it? Are you kidding me? That take was perfect!” Paul spins his monitor around theatrically and clicks the play button.

The video starts to life *en medias res*, like the beginning of a dream. I watch myself run through the steps of the double vanish almost effortlessly, a storm of swirling hands and angles. I can’t ever see the card, of course, my line of sight always blocked by a carefully positioned appendage. But I’m a magician, so I sense it by its absence; amid a flurry of distracting visual noise, the card is a subtle silence. Then I miss the last step, and a more blatant silence ensues. 

It’s visible even at full speed, but but what we see is so audaciously unbelievable that we slow down the tempo, take it frame by frame, just to make sure. Frame 63: the card hovers right above my belt buckle. My recalcitrant left hand splayed far out of position, almost half-a-foot from where it should be to pluck the jack out of the air. My betrayed right hand beginning to trace out a dramatic flourish near my chest. 

Frame 64: the card has vanished. Wile. E. Coyote can only stay suspended so long, so in the end, I have to look down. There is no card at my feet. *There is no card at my feet*. My whole body is the skin of a taut rubber band, quivering with fear and anticipation and wonder. 

Paul lets out a panicked moan. “Where is the card, Ken? Where in the *fuck* is the card?”

Somewhere buried deep inside, every kid knows that they were born to be special, to be the dashing protagonist, the beloved prince, the hero of their own story. I thought my version of this particular delusion had been soundly defeated after the ADD and the dyslexia and the scars of a devastatingly awkward puberty. (By the time I discovered magic tricks, it was far too late for my stage name of “Ken the Magnificent” to be anything but bitterly ironic).

But there’s a thrumming self-confidence in my veins, and not just my usual brand of courage (i.e; obstinance blended with apathy and spiced with occasional reckless self- disregard). Some cold, dark, muggy spiritual alley has encompassed my whole life, and now I feel the faintest breath of warm sun licking at my neck. No more than a whisper, really, but even whispers can speak of prophecy. 

I lazily roll up my sleeves and take a deep breath, slow like a wave breaking on a long flat beach. Something electric tugs my fingertips in directions that don’t seem spatially possible. Everything is so unbelievably *lucid*. When I can’t hold my breath any longer, I exhale. My breath somehow simultaneously emerges as a stream of iridescent dust and as an eldritch incantation in a language I’ve never spoken. I close my eyes, count three beats, and snap my fingers. 

When it appears, it starts as the faintest shadow in the palm of my hand. But shadows fold among shadows, one, two, maybe a hundred times, until light starts to emerge from them. I don’t know who spots it first, but eventually both of us recognize the familiar rectangular shape that is beginning to coalesce — corner by corner — from a cloud of shimmering particles. When the time is right, I blow into my hand, and the mist disperses slowly. There it is. *There’s the card*. The jack of diamonds looks different now; it’s winking at me as if we share a common secret. *Magic is real.* I guess we do.

Then I take a bow, and Paul gives me a standing ovation, and as the moment of transcendence shatters back into normalcy we both laugh like we’re out of our goddamn minds.

It turned out Paul had *everything* on video, so we clean it up a bit and put it out on our Youtube channel with the self-explanatory title “MAGIC IS REAL!!!!!” Not that we really expect anyone to believe us — but there’s nothing like a little controversy to boost subscriber counts. 

In the first two days the views and votes and comments roll in. We have a blast reading them. Most people are skeptical, or think it part of some yet to-be-revealed practical joke. But there are, of course, some vindicated Wiccans. A couple of nutty Christians quoting Exodus 22:18 and condemning everybody watching the video as Satanists and hell-bound witches. A few political slapfights. A smattering of death threats. Some reasoned, soberminded speculation on whether we faked the video using the same quantum computers that the Illuminati used to fake 9/11. 

(Paul comments gravely: “If *magic* is real, don’t we have to consider the possibility that the Illuminati is real, too?”) 

On the third day, the strangest thing happens: the view count starts going *down*. A day later, the video gets taken off Youtube completely. And a day after that, our channel gets frozen, for “suspicious or fraudulent activity.” By that time, I’m expecting something, so I’m not completely surprised when the magical equivalent of the FBI blasts down the front door of our apartment. 

So here I am, kneeling, hands up in the air with a wand pressed to my back. “Agents” dressed in crisp black suits and monogrammed ties are in the process of rummaging through all my stuff. I feel like I should be more outraged, but I’m not. Hey, I’m like five years overdue for a spring cleaning anyways. 

An enormous man strides through the doorway with an aggressively fake jolliness in his stride. And when I say enormous, I mean *enormous*. Nearly two feet taller than me, broad-shouldered and bulky, built like a football linebacker with muscle to spare. How can they possibly have suits for his size? He looks me over once, twice, then turns to another agent with a clipboard, possibly the one in charge. 

“He’s a wizard,” he says perfunctorily. Then, he turns to me, and his face splits into a broad, almost mocking smile. “You’re a wizard, Ken.” 

I can’t help it. I start laughing uncontrollably. I think back to the scene in *Harry Potter* where Hagrid bursts into the shack all filled with righteous indignation, determined to give Harry his birthright. Then I look at the odd tableau around me, at the grim agents diligently sorting, categorizing, and searching all my worldly possessions. Sure, this isn’t the warm storybook welcome that somewhere deep in my heart I was expecting. But it does seem like the beginning of an adventure. A *story*. A story with a *plot*. And unless I’m mistaken … 

*You’re a wizard, Harry. Welcome to Hogwarts.*

It’s about time I get my education.
