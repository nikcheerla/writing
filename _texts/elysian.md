<h1 class="page-title">These Elysian Fields</h1>

In any society blooded enough to be worth remembering, there are those for whom the rising sun sparks no joy and the setting sun brings no hunger. Those who might cry at a feast for victors, or smile downwind of a funeral pyre, or laugh breathlessly at private little jokes that no one else understands.

(They are sure, you see, that no one else will *ever* understand.)

There are those for whom every night is a small death and every question is a bigger one. Those who search in vain for truth, or learn to lie so well they fool even themselves. Those who hear out all the old stories and creation myths and faerie-tales, and might re-imagine Sisyphus as *happy*, or Cain as defiant, or the Buddha in the throes of a vast and terrible fury. 

(They are sure, you see, that what they hear is not completely *true*.) 

There are those who seek immortality through glory and oblivion through self-abnegation. Those who fix broken watches or hope to tame the lightning. Those who care so *much* that their fingers become knives, crafting lurid, tortured art that practically begs to be broken. 

(They are sure, you see, that something can only be beautiful in destruction.)

There are those that survey the world as it appears to be, and instead of falling to their knees in grateful prayer, think to themselves, "I am not yet content."

In Greece they are called *oneiros*, or “dreamers.” On the Comanche Great Plains: *onsila*, “poor things.” In Salem they could be burned as witches and in Versailles they might face the guillotine as traitors. They are never liked, rarely even tolerated, and in most societies face exile, imprisonment, or death before they reach thirty.

Yet in one ancient tribe, remembered by no-one still living, they are called (roughly) “those-who-wish-to-kill-a-god” and accorded some small measure of respect. After puberty, on the night of a full moon, they are cast out on some impossible quest: raising the dead, catching a falling star, stopping the sun itself from rising. They set out to defy the laws of the Heavens and replace them with the will of man.

A decade later, *most* of them return from the wilds, humbled, broken, haunted, and (yet!) content. “Those-who-tried” are seen universally as heroes, with the wisdom of their submission only proving the truth of their valor. Often, they go on to become great leaders, or fearless warriors, or famed shamans, and their names live on in legend long after they die. (But they *do* die eventually, and they die a second death when someone says their name for the very last time.)

And those who never return? They are dubbed “those-who-failed”, always delivered with a mocking sneer, as if there could be no other option than ignominy and defeat.

There is no word for someone who doesn’t return because they *succeeded*. It’s not a concept that can even be expressed in the language through *any* combination of words — it is, quite literally, an unthinkable thought. But people think it, anyways. You couldn’t *not* think it.

What if some poor grasping deluded *fool* achieved exactly what they set out to achieve?

What if there’s some faraway idyll where the rivers run backwards and the sun doesn’t set and no one ever has to die?

What if things don’t always have to be the way they have to be?

What if it was actually possible to kill a god?
