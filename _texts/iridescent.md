<h1 class="page-title">Iridiscent</h1>

Let’s set the scene: summer, camping in Big Sur by the coast. Angry rocks jut out from the cliffside as if proof that beauty, too, can be magnetized. The vernal woods reflect into the streams reflect into the beach reflect into the tide-blue breaks echoing a word I never said – *iridescent*.

All the parents drew lots, and I drew the short end of the stick, so here I am all alone in the wilderness with only my thoughts to keep me company. Well, not completely alone. There’s the children I’m meant to supervise, and the cormorants. And perhaps I could understand those proud reptilian sea-birds, if I strutted a mile along the sand in their splay-taloned shoes.

The kids, though, are a lost cause. I can’t even read the first *note* of the music that moves them. 

Currently, said children are mock fighting with tree branches on the edge of the bluffs. My son (!) pushes his opponent back with savage, violent strokes, bashing away their guard with mace-like sweeps, then darting inwards to jab and harry at exposed flesh. The dueling pair is now only a couple of feet away from the cliff face.

Theoretically, I should be stepping in around now — my wife would have been shouting and boxing ears and issuing timeouts ten minutes ago — but I’m struck immobile by a wayward thought: if my son knocked his opponent off the cliff, who would I *blame*? Him? Myself? His mom? Peer pressure? As much as I love my son, he’s no responsible adult. (And what scares me most is that I have no idea how to turn him into one.)

The boys wake up to the danger one foot before the edge and call a hasty truce. It turns out there’s nothing to say to them anyways, because the whole group moves on to new diversions, laughing and running down the path to the beach to gambol in the waves. The ocean can be dangerous this time of year, so I keep an eye on them at first, but soon my thoughts start to drift.

Sometime later, a voice behind me stirs me from my brooding.

“Dad?”

“You caught me on the lip of a vast and terrible solitude,” I say. “Any further and I’d actually have to contemplate my feelings, and that wouldn’t, — I finally turn around and take a good look at him, muddy, barefoot, and bleeding from long thin scratches on his knees and elbows — “Christ, you look like you got into a fight with a bear!”

The kid said nothing for a time, like he was actually processing what I was saying and figuring out what it *meant*. (Adults never really do that.)

“Pops, you’d never lie to me, would you?” he finally asks.

I crouch until I’m about eye level with him. “Kiddo, if this is about Santa Claus we already told you last Christmas —“ 

“No, it’s not about Santa,” he says, “It’s just … it’s just that we were talking about the camping trip next year. And I asked if we could keep doing this for the next twenty summers, and they laughed and said that in twenty years we’d all be adults and have families of our own. Is that true?”

“Yeah,” I say. “One day you’re going to be an adult.”

His face scrunches up in a mock frown. “So you mean something’s going to *happen* to me … to make me all sad and bored and broody like you guys are?”

For a few seconds, I vividly imagine playing out a scene from a Hallmark card; me trying on my gruff, macho dad voice, patting him on the back, and booming, “Not if I have something to do about it.” Then going on to play a game of catch with him out in the woods, father-to-son, proving once and for all that adults can be fun, too. Cue inspiring music, brass horns and trumpets and soaring violins, as the camera slowly fades to black.

*You’d never lie to me, would you?* I think of his sister, angry and lost in college, not returning any of our phone calls unless we change our Caller ID. Of my own scars and bruises, or the nightmares I have every now and then, legacies of a misspent youth. I can’t do that. Instead, I lean away from him, cross my arms, and say: “Yes, of course. Everybody grows up one day. And you’re not going to like all of it while it’s happening. But look on the bright side: at least when you’re older, I promise you, nobody will tell you what to do. Not your mom, not me, not anyone.”

That brought a smile to his face. “Really?”

“Really,” I say gravely. “Now, go make yourself presentable and brush the dirt off your clothes and wash those cuts with some seawater. You know, I would never endorse *lying*, but if you could *imply* to your mom that you were hit by a falling branch, it would save me a world of trouble.”

A panicked yowl from the beach interrupts me, and we hurry over to the edge of the cliffs. Below, one of the oldest boys is squirming under a mid-sized rock like a hermit crab trying to escape its home. Unbidden, Kahlil Gibran floats to the surface of my mind: pain is just the breaking of a shell. 

“Now that is what we call growing up.”

I don’t know if he says it, or I say it, but either way it sounds like a seashell — just the tiniest bit iridescent.
